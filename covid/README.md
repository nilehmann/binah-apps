# Distant Socialing

The app is divided in a [client](https://github.com/nilehmann/binah-apps/tree/master/covid/client) written with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and a [server](https://github.com/nilehmann/binah-apps/tree/master/covid/server) written with Binah.

## Development

### Get the code

Clone the repo including submodules

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/nilehmann/binah-apps/
```

### Run the code

For local development you need to run both the [client](https://github.com/nilehmann/binah-apps/tree/master/covid/client#readme) and [server](https://github.com/nilehmann/binah-apps/tree/master/covid/server#readme). Se each README for further instruction.

## Production

### Build the code

To build the code for production run:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

This will create bundle files for the client app and compile the haskell code. It'll then copy everything to `dist/`.

Alternatively, you can specify a docker image to build the binaries. Only the haskell code will be built inside the container. The image needs to have stack installed.

```bash
$ ./build.sh -i image
```

### Run the code

In production you need to run the server with `--static` specifying a directory to serve static files from. When `--static` is specified the server will also respond for any unknown route with `index.html` (routes are handled in the client by vue).
For example, assuming you built the code with `build.sh` you can run the server like this:

```bash
$ dist/disco --static=dist/static
```
